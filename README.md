# Simple Todo Website
This is a straightforward todo website built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by categorizing them into "All", "Active" and "Completed" tabs. When a task is checked as completed, it moves from the "Active" tab to the "Completed" tab while still being visible in the "All" tab.
